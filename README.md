# EbayMrkt-chromeTool

The goal of this project is to make a market research tool for Ebay sellers.
This will be in the form of a chrome browser extension that will parse the completed
listings and return data on how often the item sells at various prices. Providing
the user with quick data analysis to determine their own prices with confidence :)
